## **Project title:** Spiking dynamics of neuronal populations in the hippocampus

A project provided by potential PhD supervisor David Dupret to commence data analysis on hippocampal cells to showcase skill set.

Assumptions made throughout answering questions:

- .res and .clu are from mvl10-200109_2 whereas .des is from mnl10-200109 (session 1 I assume) therefore the data provided might be from different sessions
- Assume the index of .des = cluster ID. So index 0 = cluster ID 1, and index 1 = Cluster ID 2 so I can remove index 0 as it relates to cluster ID as per document request

**Question(s) to be asked using the data:** from increasing levels of complexity (with no real upper limit!)

Question 1: Load the spike times (stored in the .res file) along with their associated cell identity (stored in the .clu file for each recorded spike in the .res; the phenotype of which is reported in the .des file). Do you now have the same number of lines extracted from the .res and the .clu files? That is, are these two files correctly aligned in your analytical framework? Do not forget, cluster 1 should not be used. So spare memory allocation and processing time on your computer!
